02 PCAP QUESTIONS
To answer these 4 questions, you will need to use tcpdump and BPF's against the capstone-bpf.pcap file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1:
Using BPFâ€™s, determine how many packets with a DSCP of 26 being sent to the host 10.0.0.103.
Provide the number of packets converted to BASE64.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2:
What is the total number of fragmented packets?
Provide the number of packets converted to BASE64.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3:
How many packets have the DF flag set and has ONLY the RST and FIN TCP Flags set?
Provide the number of packets converted to BASE64.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4:
An attacker is targeting the host 10.0.0.104 with either a TCP full or half open scan.
Based off the pcap, how many ports are open?
Provide the number of ports converted to BASE64.
