Network Device Operation Mode

  Routed mode -- the firewall is a "routed hop" in the network. It has addressable interfaces in different          networks, can perform NAT between connected networks, and can use routing protocols to relay information          between security zones.

  Transparent mode -- A transparent firewall is placed on the network as a Layer 2 device that acts like a          "bump in the wire". It is not seen as a hop to connected devices is also called a "stealth firewall".             Benefits to this type of setup include it makes it much more difficult for an attacker to find the firewall       and perform reconnaissance such as "Firewalking".
