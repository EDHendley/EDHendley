Snort IDS/IPS rule - HEADER
[action] [protocol] [s.ip] [s.port] [direction] [d.ip] [d.port] ( match conditions ;)



EXAMPLES:
Look for anonymous ftp traffic
  alert tcp any any -> any 21 (msg:"Anonymous FTP Login"; content: "anonymous"; sid 2121; )
At byte 6
 (... ; offset:5; ...; )
This will search the first 14 bytes of the packet looking for the word “anonymous”.
  alert tcp any any -> any 21 (msg:"Anonymous FTP Login"; content: "anonymous"; depth:14; sid:2121; )
Deactivates the case sensitivity of a text search.
  alert tcp any any -> any 21 (msg:"Anonymous FTP Login"; content: "anonymous"; nocase; sid:2121; )

Rule Header
ICMP ping sweep
  alert icmp any any -> 10.1.0.2 any (msg: "NMAP ping sweep Scan"; dsize:0; sid:10000004; rev: 1; )
Look for a specific set of Hex bits (NoOP sled)
  alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"NoOp sled"; content: "|9090 9090 9090|"; sid:9090; rev: 1; )
Incorrect telnet login attempt
  alert tcp any 23 -> any any (msg:"TELNET login incorrect"; content:"Login incorrect"; flow:established,from_server; classtype:bad-unknown; sid:2323; rev:6; )

/etc/snort
/etc/snort/snort.conf
when a rule hits,
  stored in /var/log/snort + stores the pcap

Start Snort Daemon to watch for hits
snort -D -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -l /var/log/snort
**might have to sudo to run daemon**

saving rules
cd /etc/snort/rules
echo 'alert icmp any any -> any any (msg: "rules stuffs"; content:"Bad Intentions"; sid:42069; rev 1; )' >> snortRuleName.rules
restart snort daemon to watch for newly updated alerts/rules

to run a specific rule
sudo snort -D -l /var/log/snort/ -c /etc/snort/rules/<name.rules>

FAILED IDS/IPS
Fail Open
  if system goes down, the network connection stays open and allows traffic through. use if network availability is preferred
Fail Close
  if system does down, network connection closes and does NOT allow traffic through, us if network security is preferred

to run snort against pcap
sudo snort -r <pcap.pcap> -l <log path> -c <rule path>

TYPE proto IP PORT -> IP PORT (msg:"";itype:;icode:;sid:;)



alert udp any any -> 10.0.0.0/8 137 (msg:"message found";sid:100096;)
alert udp any any -> 10.0.0.0/8 138 (msg:"message found";sid:100095;)
