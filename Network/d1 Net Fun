  deci to binary -->  128  64  32  16    8  4  2  1
  binary to hex -->    8    4   2   1 |  8  4  2  1

  base 64, lookes like a bunch of random characters, usually ending in == or some other symbol. decode this

FRAG PROCESS
Version (4) IHL (usually 5), 4*5 = 20 bytes,
if MTU is 1500 byte, subtract by 20 bytes to account for header, then divide by 8
1500-20=1480/8 = 185 byte offset 

SOCKS
used for dynamic tunneling and port forwarding

SMB/CIFS 
SMB is microsoft propriatary. CIFS is open source. SAMBA is the linux version of SMB. est connections and share files

6. PRESENTATION LAYER

  
    Presentation Layer — This layer deals with the Translating, Formatting, Encryption, and Compression of data.

        Translation - The presentation layer is responsible for interoperability between encoding methods as different computers use different encoding methods. It translates data between the formats the network requires and the format at the computer.

        Formatting - This layer is responsible to put the file in a format that is readable. Such as:

            ASCII or EBCDIC

            .doc, .ppt or .xls

            mp3 or wav

            avi or mp4

            bmp, jpeg, gif, tiff or png

        Encryption This is the layer the encryption and decryption gets carried out.

            Symetric: AES, Blowfish, Twofish, DES, and RC4

            Asymetric: PKI, Deffie-Hellman, DSS, RSA, Elliptic curve

        Compression Sometimes data gets to big to transmit over the network so The Presentation layer handles compression.The primary role of Data compression is to reduce the number of bits to be transmitted. It is important in transmitting multimedia such as audio, video, text etc.

LAYER 2 SWITCHING

CAM TABLE
VLAN, 801.1q
902.1ad "Q in Q
STP
  Spanning Tree Protocols, multple switches together. STP elects the switch closest to the router to be the root switch. prevents looping thus prev attacks that use looping
CDP - Cisco Discovery Protocol
LLDP - Link Layer Discovery Protocol
DTP - Dynamic Trunking Protocol. Allows switches to "trunk" ports. Carry multiple VLAN connections on a single connect

VTP - VLAN trunking protocol, disceminate VLAN info to many switches/clients to easily apply changes and configurations

PORT SECURITY

LAYER 3 ROUTING TECHNOLOGIES

Routing Tables

Anatomy of Routing
https://net.cybbh.io/public/networking/latest/lesson-1-fundamentals/_images/Route_Types.png
    Ultimate route is any routing table entry that has a next-hop IPv4 address, exit interface, or both.
    Level 1 route is any route with the subnet mask (CIDR) is equal to or less than the classful mask of the network address. A level 1 route can be a:
        Network route - A network route that has a subnet mask equal to that of the classful mask.
            Class A - 255.0.0.0 (/8)
            Class B - 255.255.0.0 (/16)
            Class C - 255.255.255.0 (/24)
        Supernet route - A network route with a mask less (smaller) than the classful mask.
        Default route - A default route is a static route with the address 0.0.0.0/0.
    Parent route is a level 1 network that is subnetted. A parent route will never be an ultimate route.
    Level 2 child route are the subnets of a classful network address.

Administrative Distance    dynamic (what the router learns about other routers) >>> static (what admin tells it)

Table 6. Metric
  RIP      Hop count
  EIGRP    Bandwidth, Delay, Load, Reliability
  OSPF     Cost (Bandwidth)
  IS-IS    Cost (Assigned by Admin)
  BGP      Policy assigned my Admin

other metrics:
  hop,bandwidth,delay,reliability.load,MTU,cost,admin defined

BGP
  shortest and most specific routes. Very slow and resource intense
  hard to defend
