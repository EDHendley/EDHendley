Math and base formats
  deci to binary -->  128  64  32  16    8  4  2  1
  binary to hex -->    8    4   2   1 |  8  4  2  1

  base 64, lookes like a bunch of random characters, usually ending in == or some other symbol. decode this

IETF - determines how a protocol works
IANA - manage IPs
IEEE - manage communications (cables+wifi)

MAC (Media Access Control) (layer 1 to 2)
LLC (Logical Link Control) (layer 2 to 3)

Ethernet Header
  EtherType 0800 =IPv4  0806 = ARP  86DD = IPv6  8100 = VLAN  8100 0064 = VLAN /w tag
      


FRAG PROCESS
Version (4) IHL (usually 5), 4*5 = 20 bytes,
if MTU is 1500 byte, subtract by 20 bytes to account for header, then divide by 8
1500-20=1480/8 = 185 byte offset 

SOCKS
used for dynamic tunneling and port forwarding

SMB/CIFS 
SMB is microsoft propriatary. CIFS is open source. SAMBA is the linux version of SMB. est connections and share files

6. PRESENTATION LAYER

  
    Presentation Layer — This layer deals with the Translating, Formatting, Encryption, and Compression of data.

        Translation - The presentation layer is responsible for interoperability between encoding methods as different computers use different encoding methods. It translates data between the formats the network requires and the format at the computer.

        Formatting - This layer is responsible to put the file in a format that is readable. Such as:

            ASCII or EBCDIC

            .doc, .ppt or .xls

            mp3 or wav

            avi or mp4

            bmp, jpeg, gif, tiff or png

        Encryption This is the layer the encryption and decryption gets carried out.

            Symetric: AES, Blowfish, Twofish, DES, and RC4

            Asymetric: PKI, Deffie-Hellman, DSS, RSA, Elliptic curve

        Compression Sometimes data gets to big to transmit over the network so The Presentation layer handles compression.The primary role of Data compression is to reduce the number of bits to be transmitted. It is important in transmitting multimedia such as audio, video, text etc.
