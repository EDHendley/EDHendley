POF
  passive OS fingerprinting
    looks at variations in intial TTL, frag flag, default ip header length, window size, TCP options
  sudo p0f -i eth0
  sudo cat /var/log/po0.log | channel 
  sudo p0f -r <file.pcap> -o /var/log/p0f.log

WIRESHARK
  Protocol Hierachy Statistics
    specific protocols
    malformed packets
  Conversations
    look for one sided communciations
  ENDPOINTS
  IO Graph, monitor network traffic over course  of pcap
  Expert information

TCPDUMP
sudo tcpdump <fileName.pcapL
  will spit out pcap info in CLI
sudo tcpdump -r practice.pcap 'tcp[13] =0x02'
  'tcp[13] =0x02' is SYN packet

Network Data Types
    Full Packet Capture Data (pcap)
    Session Data
        sflow (only show a few packets at a time)
        NetFlow (cpu intense)
    Statistical Data
      traffic data, user, stuff you put in powerpoint and show boss/customer
    Packet String Data
    Alert Data
    Log Data
