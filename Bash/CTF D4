Activity:

Design a script that detects the existence of directory: $HOME/.ssh

Upon successful detection, copies any and all files from within the directory $HOME/.ssh to directory $HOME/SSH and produce no output. You will need to create $HOME/SSH.
Upon un-successful detection, displays the error message "Run ssh-keygen" to the user.
NOTE: If the $HOME/.ssh directory does not exist, one may run the ssh-keygen command. Accept all defaults for the purposes of this exercise. This is not necessary for passing the activity but can be used for testing on your local machine.

ANSWER
if [ -d $HOME/.ssh ];
then 
mkdir $HOME/SSH
cp -R $HOME/.ssh/* $HOME/SSH
else
echo "Run ssh-keygen"
fi

Activity:

Write a script that determines your default gateway ip address. Assign that address to a variable using command substitution.
NOTE: Networking on the CTFd is limited for security reasons. ip route and route are emulated. Use either of those with no arguments/switches.
Have your script determine the absolute path of the ping application. Assign the absolute path to a variable using command substitution. HINT: man which
Have your script send six ping packets to your default gateway, utilizing the path discovered in the previous step, and assign the response to a variable using command substitution.
Evaluate the response as being either successful or failure, and print an appropriate message to the screen.
Pseudo Example:

A=$(command_1)
B=$(command_2)
C=$($A command_3 $B)
if [[ "$" <condition> "$" ]]; then
   echo "successful";
else
   echo "failure";
fi 

ANSWER:
A=$(which ping)
B=$(ip route | grep default | cut -d' ' -f3)
C=$($A -c6 $B | grep loss | cut -d, -f6 | cut -d% -f1)
test='0'
if [[ '$C' -eq '0' ]]; then
   echo "successful";
else
   echo "failure";
fi
