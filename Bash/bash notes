more /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1  d is delimiter, my default it delimits by tab, here we are delimiting by colon(:), -f1 being field 1, here it will return the first field of passwd, which is the user's name
more /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f3- here -f3- is signifing we want field three and the hyphen (-) at the end is stating everything else, so this will return the results of more /etc/passwd with the 3rd field appearing first and everything else after that
"                          -f1,3  this will return fields 1 and 3.    the fields are established because our delimiter is the colon.

"                | cut -c3-10  is showing characters(c) 3 through 10
"                | cut -d- -f1- -s  will only show files that contain the delimiter, in this case the hyphen(-)
echo "cosc zero seven" | cut -d" " -f2 --complement  will result in cosc seven, --complement signals to exclude the second field
&     sends command to background and will run it indefinetly
