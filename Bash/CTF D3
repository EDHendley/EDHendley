Activity:

Using find, find all files under the $HOME directory with a .bin extension ONLY.
Once the file(s) and their path(s) have been found, remove the file name from the absolute path output.
Ensure there is no trailing / at the end of the directory path when outputting to standard output.
You may need to sort the output depending on the command(s) you use. Have each path displayed only once.
Tip: For stripping the filename out of the output, there are different ways that this can be accomplished based on what you have learned so far.

Utilizing -printf options on find.
Utilizing awk to manipulate the fields. This may leave the trailing / if you don't take that into account.
Utilizing the rev and cut commands creatively.

ANSWER
find ~ -iname "*.bin" 2>/dev/null | rev | cut -d. -f2 | rev | sort -u
