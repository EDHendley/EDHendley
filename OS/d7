ps -elf                is king of showing processes 
For kernel-space processes [kthreadd] ( PID = 2 )

For user-space processes /sbin/init ( PID = 1 )
  ps --ppid 1          shows child processes of 1

htop      view processes in real time
ps -elf --forest       shows process tree

PROCESS OWNERSHIP
  effective user ID (euid) defines access rights for a proces
  real user ID (ruid)
  
SYSTEM CALLS
  an interaction between a process and the kernel
two calls, fork() and exec()
  fork, the kernel creates a nearly identical copy of process
  exec, the kernel starts a progam, replacing the current process
kill -l   shows all kill signals we can send, 64 of them

ORPHAN & ZOMBIE (DEFUNCY) PROCESSES
  daemons are orphans, similar to a type of service
  once parent killed, orphan is adopted by sbin/init
disown -a && exit    close shell and force all children to be adopted

Zombie (defunct)
completed process but still taking a spot in the process table
cant be closeed with kil unless it parent is killed, doesnt use resources but takes up a entry space

Fork bomb, DOS attack where a process continuakky replicates itself to deplete resources of host
  fixed with ulimit 0u 30

ps -elf | grep -v grep | grep sleep
